Go-kstat provides a Go API for the kstat kernel statistics system
on Solaris, Illumos, OmniOS, and other Solaris derived systems. For
general information on kstats, see the kstat(1) and kstat(3kstat)
manpages. For more documentation on the details of the package, see
doc.go and kstat_solaris.go.

This package is quite young, so the API may well change as I and
other people gain experience with using it.

At the moment the API only supports access to what are called 'named'
kstat statistics. While most Solaris kernel stats are named ones, the
major exception is disk IO statistics. See the API LIMITATIONS AND TODOS
section of doc.go for more details (and for other API limitations).

This is a cgo-based package so it can't be cross compiled like a regular
Go package. It may also have bugs with memory management, since it
interacts with the Solaris kstat library and holds references to memory
that's been dynamically allocated in C.

Bug reports and other contributions are highly welcome.

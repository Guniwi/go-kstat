This directory contains files that were used as the starting point to
generate types_solaris_amd64.go. These were run through cgo -godef and
then edited, mostly to add comments. The Mntinfo type took significant
hand editing, both before cgo and after it, but at some point this will be
worked around/fixed in cgo. See:
